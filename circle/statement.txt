Problem Statement
This exercise includes 3 bonuses and 7 hints (hover over the hint links before clicking on them).

We recommend Mixed-level users solve up to the first bonus for this exercise.

I want you to make a class that represents a circle.

The circle should have a radius, a diameter, and an area. It should also have a nice string representation.

For example:

>>> c = Circle(5)
>>> c
Circle(5)
>>> c.radius
5
>>> c.diameter
10
>>> c.area
78.53981633974483
Additionally the radius should default to 1 if no radius is specified when you create your circle:

>>> c = Circle()
>>> c.radius
1
>>> c.diameter
2
There are three bonuses for this exercise.

Bonus 1
For the first bonus, make sure when the radius of your class changes that the diameter and area both change as well:

>>> c = Circle(2)
>>> c.radius = 1
>>> c.diameter
2
>>> c.area
3.141592653589793
>>> c
Circle(1)
If you get stuck on this bonus, make sure to check the hints.
